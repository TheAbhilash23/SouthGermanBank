<h1>South German Bank Project</h1>

This repository contains a project on <b>"Prediction of customer credit risk of South German Bank"</b> whose problem statement and requirement was shared by iNeuron.ai .

I have used HTML, CSS for Frontend development.

For Backend development I have used Python. This includes <b>Django </b> and <b> Django Rest Framework </b>.The data architecture is monolith for the limited scope of the project.

The Data model has been designed in such a way that it makes the project coherent with its  objectives.

I have also used python for AI and ML modelling for <b> Predicting Customer Credit Risk </b>.
